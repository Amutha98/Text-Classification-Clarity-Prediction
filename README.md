# Text-Classification-Clarity-Prediction
### Description:

Developed a machine learning model to classify text into different categories and predict text clarity. This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze paragraph-sized text data.

### Key Tasks:

#### âœ” Topic Classification: Built a model to classify text into five categories:

Artificial Intelligence

Movies about Artificial Intelligence

Programming

Philosophy

Biographies

#### âœ” Text Clarity Prediction: Developed a prototype to determine whether a paragraph is clear enough or not clear enough, using both labeled and unlabeled data.

#### âœ” Ethical Considerations: Evaluated the potential risks of automating content rejection based on clarity scores and provided recommendations.

### Skills & Technologies:
ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (NLP), Word Embeddings, Scikit-learn

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Feature Engineering

ðŸ”¹ Ethical AI & Bias Mitigation
